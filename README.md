Web Project

Nowadays we can say that the fashion for visits of restaurants has returned. But times change and in the 21st century people start to get used to IT technologies. That's why we want to create the application for restaurants, in order to make people's lives easier. 
          First of all, our app will be helpful for clients, because they spend less time for making orders and waiting the waiters. For instance, people often do not have time even for waiting orders. Using our website they can make an order sitting at home or on the way to the restaurant. And to the arrival to restaurant their dishes will be already cooked. 
	Secondly, it will be useful for the people who have problems with communicating, for those who cannot talk or decide what to order in front of other people. In this case people can reduce contact with people. 
	For owners our app will reduce expenses of waiters. There will be less of them, because their main job will be to deliver dishes. Also, there are always dissatisfied clients, which write complaints to an establishment, which also lowers the rating of the restaurant. That is to say, using our application, owners and clients will be satisfied at both sides.
The aim of this project is the realization of the app to process online orders in restaurants. To facilitate the work with the app, we will create a user-friendly interface for future users.
All information on our website will be divided into several types:
1) Menu. Products vary by kitchen, type, price, etc.
2) The text information. This includes articles, reviews, descriptions, instructions, comments, etc.
3) Multimedia (video, photos, audio, graphics, flash, animation, etc.).
4) Mixed content. For example, one page may contain video (multimedia), its factual information, description and reviews (reviews) users.
The use of this content will be used for the restaurant's menu. Here you can view all the products necessary for adding dishes to order, and transmit it further to the operator of the restaurant. The operator sends the customer an approximate time of cooking dishes.
    	The average cooking time calculation is based on the number of dishes already ordered. The operator indicates the order to the kitchen, where he reported the approximate waiting time, taking into account existing queue of orders. The time is reported to the client, and then he has the right to confirm or cancel the order.
          To make an order, the customer needed a temporary registration on the site. The user enters a valid phone number in the appropriate text box. After that, average waiting time and the special code in order to confirm the order will be sent on the number dialed. If the customer enters the code on the site, his order is automatically confirmed.
          After confirming the order, the customer needs to pay for the selected items. To do this, we will provide the ability to use e-wallet or bank card on our website. The user's entered data need to be kept confident as possible. This ensures the safety of use of the service.
          In addition, to find the address of the restaurant on our site you can use the interactive map. There will be marked the location of restaurant and its affiliates. This ensures easy navigation for customers, where you can choose the closest restaurant to your current position.
Using Machine Learning we will collect the data from the users and identify the most popular products and restaurants.
